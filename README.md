# Article Analyzer
I think the article analyzer is of great help to creators or students, because of its appearance, more good writers may appear.

For the design of this product, I think it should include the following functions: 
1. Web version and mobile app version. 
2. Background training set and training results 
3. Data storage and transmission server 
4. User feedback interface 
5. Storage and calculation
#  1.Web and mobile app
Our product should contain a web version and a mobile version, so we need a mobile terminal to build the web version. This part includes the interface of our product and the function that allows users to upload their own articles. It should also include an interface for users to get feedback (to judge whether their grammar is correct or plagiarism, etc.). A library interface is also needed, allowing users to directly find the articles they want to use (articles in the library need to be approved by the author).

#  2.Background training and results & 3. Data storage and transmission server 
The main purpose of this product is to serve creators. When they upload their own works, we need to perform a lot of calculations on our database and show whether their articles are qualified. Therefore, the size of our database must be very large.

#  4. User feedback interface 
Because this product is a service product, user feedback is also very important. So we need an additional module for users to give feedback on the product. For example, when they can't find the document they want to use, or are not satisfied with the grammar and writing style of the product, they need a user interface for feedback. The function of this module is to store the feedback of these users in our database and give users a feedback and solution.

#  5. Storage and calculation
This product involves a lot of storage and calculations. It needs to store the user's work and output the result of identification. But to ensure that this part is encrypted, we cannot disclose the articles uploaded by users. A server for computing is also required.
